I would like to make a social media application called Interludes.
Users have a Profile with an avatar, about section, and their current status.
Users can have many posts. They can write them as drafts and publish them later.
Users can add hashtags in their content. They can also subscribe to hashtags.
Users can up and down vote posts. They should be able to see all posts the voted on.
Users can follow and block each other. They can also be banned and appeal their ban.
